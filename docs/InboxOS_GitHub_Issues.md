## Issue #1: [Feature] Implement HTML-to-Text Email Parser with Invoice Table Preservation

**Labels:** `feature`, `parser`, `backend`, `hard`
**Assignee:** P6 — Parser Specialist
**Linked Prompt:** P6.1

### Description
Currently, email bodies are stored as raw HTML. The AI intelligence layer and frontend display both struggle with malformed HTML, inline styles, and tracking pixels. We need a robust HTML-to-text converter that produces clean Markdown while preserving critical structures like invoice tables.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `backend/src/services/parser/html-converter.service.ts`
- [ ] Convert HTML email bodies to clean Markdown using `html-to-text` + `turndown`
- [ ] Handle malformed HTML gracefully (fallback to plain text)
- [ ] Preserve invoice tables in Markdown table format
- [ ] Strip all JavaScript, CSS, tracking pixels, and hidden elements
- [ ] Configurable max output length (default 10,000 chars)
- [ ] Integrate into the email ingestion pipeline (call after receiving raw HTML)
- [ ] Update `Email` model to store `cleanedBody` alongside `bodyHtml`

### Technical Notes
- Use `cheerio` for DOM manipulation (already in dependency tree via other packages)
- Must be async and return within <100ms for typical emails
- Test with real-world HTML emails: newsletters, invoices, meeting invites

### Why This Matters
Without this, the AI sees messy HTML tags instead of readable text, reducing classification accuracy. The frontend also renders poorly when displaying raw HTML.

## Issue #2: [Feature] Build Email Signature Detection & Removal System

**Labels:** `feature`, `parser`, `backend`, `medium`
**Assignee:** P6 — Parser Specialist
**Linked Prompt:** P6.2

### Description
Email signatures clutter AI analysis and waste tokens. We need an intelligent signature stripper that detects and removes signature blocks while preserving them separately for potential future use (e.g., contact extraction).

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `backend/src/services/parser/signature-stripper.service.ts`
- [ ] Detect patterns: `--\n`, "Best regards", "Sent from my iPhone", "Confidentiality notice"
- [ ] Handle multi-line signatures with names, titles, phones, social links
- [ ] Support 3 sensitivity levels: strict, moderate, lenient
- [ ] Return `{ cleanedBody: string, signature: string | null }`
- [ ] Add `signature` field to `Email` model (Prisma schema + migration)
- [ ] Must NOT strip legitimate content containing signature-like phrases
- [ ] Deterministic: same input → same output

### Technical Notes
- Pure function, no database calls
- Handle signatures in multiple languages
- Test with 50+ real email samples

## Issue #3: [Feature] Detect & Remove Quoted Reply Chains from Email Threads

**Labels:** `feature`, `parser`, `backend`, `medium`
**Assignee:** P6 — Parser Specialist
**Linked Prompt:** P6.3

### Description
When users view an email in a thread, they see the entire quoted history ("On Monday, John wrote..."). This wastes AI tokens and creates a poor reading experience. We need to extract only the fresh content written by the latest sender.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `backend/src/services/parser/quoted-reply-detector.service.ts`
- [ ] Detect patterns: `>`, `|`, `From:`, `On [date] [name] wrote:`, `-----Original Message-----`
- [ ] Handle nested quotes (multiple `>>>>>` levels)
- [ ] Use string diffing to detect repeated content blocks across thread emails
- [ ] Return only the newest content
- [ ] Store full thread context separately for AI processing
- [ ] Add `threadContext` field to `Thread` model

### Technical Notes
- Must handle Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, Thunderbird quoting styles
- Must NOT remove inline quotes where sender references previous text
- Pure function, no DB calls

## Issue #4: [Feature] Extract Actionable Links & Attachment Metadata from Emails

**Labels:** `feature`, `parser`, `backend`, `medium`
**Assignee:** P6 — Parser Specialist
**Linked Prompt:** P6.4

### Description
Emails contain critical actionable elements: unsubscribe links, payment buttons, meeting links, and attachments. We need to extract and categorize these so the AI and frontend can surface them intelligently.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `backend/src/services/parser/link-attachment-extractor.service.ts`
- [ ] Extract links: href, anchor text, button detection, categorization (unsubscribe, confirm, download, meeting, payment)
- [ ] Extract attachments: filename, contentType, byteSize, contentId, inline vs attached
- [ ] Detect suspicious links (href ≠ display text = phishing indicator)
- [ ] Generate MD5 hash for attachment deduplication
- [ ] Add `links` and `attachments` JSONB fields to `Email` model
- [ ] Integrate into ingestion pipeline

### Technical Notes
- Use `mailparser` types for attachment extraction
- Link categorization: heuristic first, LLM fallback for ambiguous cases
- Must complete in <100ms

## Issue #5: [Feature] Build Rules Management UI for Custom Email Routing Rules

**Labels:** `feature`, `frontend`, `rules`, `hard`
**Assignee:** P7 — Frontend + P7 — Rules Engine
**Linked Prompt:** P7.1

### Description
The backend has full CRUD API for rules (`GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/rules`), but the frontend only shows static toggles. Users cannot create custom rules like "IF sender is boss@company.com THEN send Telegram AND mark important." This is a core differentiator for InboxOS.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `frontend/src/components/RulesManager.tsx` — main rules page
- [ ] Create `frontend/src/components/RuleBuilder.tsx` — visual rule builder with:
  - Condition builder (field dropdown, operator dropdown, value input)
  - Action builder (action type dropdown, config fields per action)
  - Priority slider (1-100)
  - Active toggle
- [ ] Create `frontend/src/components/RuleCard.tsx` — display rule with edit/delete
- [ ] Integrate with existing `/api/rules` endpoints
- [ ] Real-time validation with Zod schemas
- [ ] Show rule preview: "This rule will match emails where [conditions] and then [actions]"
- [ ] Drag-and-drop priority reordering
- [ ] Add "Rules" to SidebarNav

### Design Constraints
- Dark glassmorphism theme (bg-base: #080b14, accent: #6366f1)
- Responsive: condition builder stacks vertically on mobile
- Loading skeletons while fetching
- Delete requires confirmation modal

### Why This Matters
This is the #1 missing piece that prevents InboxOS from being an "operating system" vs just a smart inbox. Users need to define their own routing logic.

## Issue #6: [Feature] Implement Time-Based Active Windows & Do-Not-Disturb Mode

**Labels:** `feature`, `backend`, `rules`, `hard`
**Assignee:** P7 — Rules Engine Lead
**Linked Prompt:** P7.2

### Description
Rules currently fire 24/7. Users need control over WHEN rules are active (work hours only) and a global Do-Not-Disturb mode that suppresses all notifications during sleep hours.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Update `Rule` model: add `activeWindow` JSONB field (timezone, scheduleType, workHours, customCron, specificDates)
- [ ] Update `UserSettings` model: add `doNotDisturb` JSONB field (enabled, startTime, endTime, timezone, daysOfWeek)
- [ ] Create `backend/src/services/rules/time-validator.service.ts`
- [ ] Implement `isRuleActive(rule, currentTime?)` — supports always, work_hours, custom_cron, specific_dates
- [ ] Implement `isDNDActive(userId)` — checks user settings
- [ ] Integrate into `RulesEngineService.evaluate()` — skip inactive rules
- [ ] Integrate into ALL output adapters — check DND before sending
- [ ] Add `POST/GET /api/users/me/dnd` endpoints
- [ ] Add DND toggle to frontend Settings page

### Technical Notes
- Use `date-fns-tz` for timezone handling
- DST transitions must be handled correctly
- Holiday exclusions configurable (country code + custom dates)
- Time check must add <5ms to rule evaluation

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add `CalendarEvent` model to Prisma schema
- [ ] Create `backend/src/services/actions/calendar-extractor.service.ts`
- [ ] Use `chrono-node` for natural language date parsing
- [ ] Detect meeting links: Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, Webex
- [ ] Create `backend/src/services/actions/calendar-creator.service.ts`
- [ ] Use Google Calendar API v3 via `googleapis`
- [ ] Store user's Google Calendar OAuth tokens in `Integration` model (encrypted)
- [ ] Add `POST /api/actions/calendar/events` endpoint
- [ ] Show upcoming meetings in frontend EmailViewer sidebar

### Technical Notes
- Must handle timezone correctly (parse in sender's TZ, convert to user's TZ)
- Must be idempotent (upsert by googleEventId)
- Graceful fallback if no Google Calendar credentials

**Labels:** `feature`, `actions`, `backend`, `medium`
**Assignee:** P8 — Actions Engineer
**Linked Prompt:** P8.2

### Description
Newsletters and promotional emails flood users individually. We need a digest system that aggregates low-priority emails into a single daily/weekly summary email.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add `Digest` model to Prisma schema
- [ ] Create `backend/src/services/actions/digest-generator.service.ts`
- [ ] Query emails: past 24h/7d, category IN (newsletter, promotional, social) OR priorityScore < 40

**Labels:** `feature`, `actions`, `backend`, `hard`
**Assignee:** P8 — Actions Engineer
**Linked Prompt:** P8.3

### Description
Users receive hundreds of receipts (Amazon, Uber, food delivery). We need to automatically extract structured expense data and detect recurring subscriptions.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add `Expense` model to Prisma schema
- [ ] Create `backend/src/services/actions/expense-extractor.service.ts`
- [ ] Keyword filter first ("receipt", "invoice", "order confirmation") — skip LLM for non-receipts
- [ ] Use OpenAI structured outputs for extraction: amount, currency, merchant, category, date, paymentMethod, items
- [ ] Regex fallback for simple cases (`$XX.XX`, `€XX,XX`)
- [ ] Normalize merchant names ("Uber Technologies Inc" → "Uber")
- [ ] Detect recurring expenses (same merchant + similar amount + regular interval)
- [ ] Add expense summary to frontend EmailViewer sidebar

### Technical Notes
- Must complete in <2s
- Handle multiple receipts in one email
- Currency conversion: store original + USD equivalent
- Must not call LLM for non-receipt emails (save costs)

- [ ] Use BullMQ delayed jobs for scheduling
- [ ] Implement `snoozeReminder(reminderId, durationMinutes)`
- [ ] Implement `cancelReminders(emailId)` when task marked done
- [ ] Add upcoming deadlines widget to frontend dashboard

### Technical Notes
- All deadlines stored in UTC, displayed in user timezone
- Must deduplicate (same deadline extracted twice → one reminder)
- Scale to 10,000+ active reminders per user (BullMQ handles this)
- Handle past deadlines gracefully (immediate "overdue" notification)

**Labels:** `feature`, `ai`, `backend`, `hard`
**Assignee:** P10 — Advanced AI Engineer
**Linked Prompt:** P10.1

### Description
Two problems: (1) The AI doesn't extract deadlines from emails, and (2) `embedEmail()` and `searchSimilarEmails()` exist in code but have NO API endpoints or UI integration. We need to fix both.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Update AI service: add `deadlines: string[]` to structured output schema
- [ ] Add `deadline` field to `ActionItem` model, `deadlines` to `EmailAnalysis` model
- [ ] Create `backend/src/routes/rag.routes.ts`:
  - `POST /api/rag/index` — trigger embedding for email(s)
  - `POST /api/rag/search` — semantic search with cosine similarity
- [ ] Ensure pgvector extension enabled in PostgreSQL
- [ ] Add `embedding` vector(1536) to `Email` model (raw SQL for vector type)
- [ ] Create BullMQ background job `indexEmailsJob` for batch indexing
- [ ] Add semantic search UI to frontend (search bar with "AI-powered" toggle)

## Issue #14: [Feature] Add Ollama Local LLM Support for Privacy Mode

**Labels:** `feature`, `ai`, `backend`, `medium`
**Assignee:** P10 — Advanced AI Engineer
**Linked Prompt:** P10.2

### Description
The frontend already has an "Ollama" dropdown option in AI Settings, but the backend has NO handler for it. Users who want privacy (no data to OpenAI/Google) need local LLM support.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create `backend/src/services/ai-providers/ollama.provider.ts`
- [ ] Implement same interface as OpenAI/Gemini providers:
  - `classify(subject, body)`
  - `extractActionItems(subject, body)`
  - `generateSummary(threadEmails)`
- [ ] Use axios to call `http://localhost:11434/api/generate`
- [ ] Support `llama3` and `mistral` (configurable via `OLLAMA_MODEL`)
- [ ] Implement regex-based JSON extraction (Ollama has no native JSON mode)
- [ ] Add `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` and `OLLAMA_MODEL` to `.env`
- [ ] Update `ai.service.ts` provider selection to include 'ollama'
- [ ] Auto-fallback to OpenAI if Ollama is unreachable

## Issue #21: [Bug] RAG Semantic Search Exists in Code But Has No API/UI Integration

**Labels:** `bug`, `ai`, `backend`, `frontend`, `medium`
**Assignee:** P10 — Advanced AI Engineer

### Description
`embedEmail()` and `searchSimilarEmails()` are implemented in `ai.service.ts` and `test-embeddings.ts`, but there is NO way for users to actually use semantic search. The search bar falls back to PostgreSQL `ILIKE` pattern matching.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Open frontend inbox
2. Type "DBMS project deadline" in search
3. Observe: only exact/partial text matches returned, not semantically similar emails

### Expected Behavior
Search should use pgvector cosine similarity to find emails with related meaning even if keywords don't match exactly.

### Fix Required
- Expose `POST /api/rag/search` endpoint
- Add semantic search toggle to frontend search bar
- Ensure pgvector extension is enabled
- Background job to index historical emails

## Issue #22: [Bug] WhatsApp Action in RulesEngine Has No Dispatch Implementation

**Labels:** `bug`, `outputs`, `backend`, `high`
**Assignee:** P9 — Integration & Outputs Lead

### Description
The RulesEngine evaluates rules and can produce a `sendWhatsApp` action, but `whatsapp.adapter.ts` does not exist. The action logs a warning and does nothing.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a rule with action `sendWhatsApp`
2. Trigger an email that matches the rule
3. Check logs: "WhatsApp adapter not implemented"

### Expected Behavior
User receives a WhatsApp message within 60 seconds.

### Fix Required
- Implement `backend/src/services/outputs/whatsapp.adapter.ts`
- Integrate Twilio SDK
- Add WhatsApp credentials to Integration model
- Add connection UI to frontend Settings

---

## Issue #23: [Bug] Ollama Option in Frontend Has No Backend Handler

**Labels:** `bug`, `ai`, `backend`, `medium`
**Assignee:** P10 — Advanced AI Engineer

### Description
The frontend AI Settings page has an "Ollama" dropdown option, but selecting it causes all AI operations to fail because the backend only handles 'openai' and 'gemini' providers.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Go to Settings → AI
2. Select "Ollama" as provider
3. Save
4. Send a test email
5. Observe: AI classification fails with "Unknown provider: ollama"

### Expected Behavior
Backend routes requests to local Ollama instance, or falls back to OpenAI if Ollama is offline.

### Fix Required
- Create `ollama.provider.ts`
- Update provider factory in `ai.service.ts`
- Add `.env` variables for Ollama

---

## Issue #24: [Bug] No Frontend UI for Creating Custom Rules Despite Backend API Existing

**Labels:** `bug`, `frontend`, `high`
**Assignee:** P7 — Frontend

### Description
Backend has full CRUD for rules (`GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/rules`), but the frontend only shows a static rules preview and global notification toggles. Users cannot create, edit, or delete custom rules.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Log in to dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings → Rules (or wherever rules are shown)
3. Observe: only static text, no "Add Rule" button

### Expected Behavior
Visual rule builder with conditions, actions, priority, and drag-and-drop reordering.

### Fix Required
- Build `RulesManager.tsx`, `RuleBuilder.tsx`, `RuleCard.tsx`
- Wire to existing `/api/rules` endpoints
- Add to SidebarNav

## Issue #25: [Enhancement] Add Deadline Extraction to AI Classification Output

**Labels:** `enhancement`, `ai`, `backend`, `medium`
**Assignee:** P10 — Advanced AI Engineer

### Description
The AI extracts action items but never extracts deadlines like "due Friday" or "submit by July 15." This prevents the reminder scheduler from working.

### Proposed Solution
Update the OpenAI structured output schema to include `deadlines: string[]` (ISO 8601 dates). Use `chrono-node` as fallback parsing.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Update AI prompt schema
- [ ] Add `deadlines` to `EmailAnalysis` model
- [ ] Add `deadline` to `ActionItem` model
- [ ] Display deadlines in frontend EmailViewer
- [ ] Feed deadlines into reminder scheduler
